# Elizabeth's Portfolio

## Overview
I conceived the design of this portfolio in `Figma` and implemented it using `Next.js` and `TypeScript`. Throughout the development journey, I familiarized myself with `NPM`, exploring its wide array of packages. I seamlessly integrated a variety of these packages into the project's framework and tailored them to harmonize with my design vision.

My favorite part was building out both a dark and light mode, and I enjoyed adding all of the animations!
